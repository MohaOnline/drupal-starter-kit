This module is just a formatter (display) of textfield, text area and text
format. The idea behind this is to provide a simple solution, easy to setup,
with few dependencies to display text on website.

Implementation:

The trim function in this module is taken from Views module with a few
modifications.

Integration:

Of course, this module is fully compatible with any modules that use entity
formatters, such as Views or Panels

Besides that, this module is extremely useful when you use it with view modes.
In order to create a new view mode, you can implement the
hook_entity_info_alter() or install Entity view modes module.

Dependencies:

- Text (Drupal 7.x Core)
- Filter (Drupal 7.x Core)

Installation:

Download the module and simply copy it into your contributed modules folder:
[for example, your_drupal_path/sites/all/modules] and enable it from the
modules administration/management page.
