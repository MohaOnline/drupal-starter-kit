Tripal Module Rating System
=============================

This module rating system is meant to aid Tripal Site Administrators in choosing extension modules for their site. It is also meant to guide developers in module best practices and celebrate modules which achieve these goals.

- Follows basic Drupal Coding standards; specifically, `code format <https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards/coding-standards>`_ and `API documentation <https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards/api-documentation-and-comment-standards#drupal>`_.
- Uses Tripal API functions. Specifically, it should use the
    - Chado Query API for querying Chado (if using Chado as the storage system). (`API <http://api.tripal.info/api/tripal/tripal_chado%21api%21tripal_chado.query.api.inc/group/tripal_chado_query_api/3.x>`_, :doc:`Tutorial <../dev_guide/chado>`)
    - Tripal Jobs API for long running processes. (`API  <http://api.tripal.info/api/tripal/tripal%21api%21tripal.jobs.api.inc/group/tripal_jobs_api/3.x>`_)
    - TripalField class to add data to pages (Tripal3). (:doc:`Tutorial <../dev_guide/custom_field>`)
- Provides ways to customize the module (e.g. drush options, field/formatter settings, admin UI).
- Latest releases should follow Drupal naming best practices.
    - e.g. first release for Drupal 7 should be: ``7.x-1.0``.

    - The elementInfo function is fully implemented.
    - The query and queryOrder functions fully implemented.

- Drupal.org vetted release (optional but encouraged).

Rate your Extension Module!
-----------------------------

We encourage Tripal module developers to rate their modules. This can be done by :doc:`./instructions`

The following badges are for inclusion on your module README and documentation; however, they are only valid if your module has been included in :doc:`../extensions` with the given rating.
