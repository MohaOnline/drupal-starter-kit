 * All static variables 'values' have changed.
 * Moved everything in user_registrationpassword_form_user_register_submit()
   function into the if() statement.
 * Created a new function: user_registrationpassword_set_message()
   to drupal_set_message() and redirect.

   >>> You need to run update.php after updating the module files. <<<

  And this update will invalidate ALL current activation links.
  Sad, true, but it's required to fix a major issue with the activation link.
  Everybody should re-request their activation links if they registered before
  this update was applied.

- Task: Added tests. (admin config page test still needs work)
- Task: Codingstandards++ (almost done).
- Task: In-code documentation++ (still needs some work).


User Registration Password 7.x-1.3 2012-09-12
---------------------------------------------
- Feature request: Translatable Confirmation E-Mail
  By kle - http://drupal.org/node/1321998
- New: The correct configuration options are set from the 1.3 release
  and higher during install. No need to configure anything from now on.
- New: The default 'Account activation' e-mail template will be
  overridden during installation, now it makes a lot more sense.
- Renamed the user_registrationpassword variable to
  'user_registrationpassword_registration'
  so we can actually remove it correctly via the uninstaller.
- Minor edit to the e-mail template.
- Small change in the logic, we used to check for the role of a user
  (if admin perms) before we called the submit handler, we now only check
  if the uid < 1. This fixes a minor possible issue. This module should
  only work if an anonymous user tries to register.
- Added an update function to update the variable names that changed.
- Added CHANGELOG.txt so people can check at all times what changed,
  even if d.o. is down. (for maintenance for example)
- Updated README.txt to reflect changes and remove wrong / unclear
  documentation.
