The "Module Permissions" module

About
======
Allow administrators to define a subset of modules to be managed by others.

What does this module do?
=========================
Allow site administrator to define a subset of modules and allow users
of another role to manage those selected modules. Those users can turn
on and off those modules as well as manage permissions for them.

What doesn't this module do?
============================
This module only manages one subset of modules available on a site.
This subset is then shared by all roles to which the admin delegates
management permissions.

Please note once a user has been granted permission to manage permissions
for selected modules they can also manage those modules' permissions for
users with higher level of access. This means which modules can be managed
by other users need to be carefully selected and the management
permissions should only be given to trusted roles.
