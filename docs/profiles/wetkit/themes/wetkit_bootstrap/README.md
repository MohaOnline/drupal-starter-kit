WxT Bootstrap
=============
A modern, SMACSS enabled theme powered by the [Bootstrap][bootstrap] base theme.

Subtheming Tips
---------------

* Run drush bootstrap-wizard
* Make sure to only select the SASS version and `NOT` the CDN
* Ensure the sub theme has the "Fix anchor positions" option disabled
* Edit the subtheme info file and remove the script tags not directly supported by WxT
* Ensure the appropriate theme settings (anchor positions) are reverted for wetkit_theme
