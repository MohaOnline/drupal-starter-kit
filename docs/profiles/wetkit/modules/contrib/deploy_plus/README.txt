-- SUMMARY --
The Deploy Plus module is like an additional layer on Deploy - Content Staging
(https://www.drupal.org/project/deploy) module, that outputs additional
information about entities in deployment plan (language, dependencies, author
etc.). Adds additional UI and more control to Deployment module. Now entities
could be added to deployment plan using Views Bulk Operations. Menu items with
custom functionality based on deploy module API. Removing one item from
deployment plan with one click. Empty whole deployment plan with one click as
well.
